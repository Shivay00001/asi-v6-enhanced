# Enhanced ASI Brain System V6.0

Advanced Persistent Learning & Human Behavior Cloning system with features 83-100, focusing on real-time learning, environment interaction, and deep reasoning.

## New Features in V6.0

- **Persistent Neural Model**: Real-time learning from external feedback with persistent memory and experience replay.
- **Environment Interface**: Self-updating world interaction, entity recognition, and relationship mapping.
- **Deep Reasoning Engine**: Multi-pass reasoning with intention understanding and common sense application.
- **Human Behavior Cloning**: (Implied/referenced in docstring) Advanced modeling of human-like adaptive behavior.

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from asi_v6_enhanced import PersistentNeuralModel, EnvironmentInterface

async def main():
    neural_model = PersistentNeuralModel()
    env = EnvironmentInterface()
    # Interact and learn
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Standard library modules (`asyncio`, `logging`, `dataclasses`, `pickle`, `hashlib`, etc.)
